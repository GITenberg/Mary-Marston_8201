description: "Mary Marston is a novel by George MacDonald, written in 1881 and later\
  \ republished as A Daughter's Devotion.\nWritten at the height of George MacDonald's\
  \ literary career, the story centers around the life of a simple merchant's daughter.\
  \ Mary Marston's unswerving commitment to love God and others is contrasted with\
  \ a backdrop of an array of characters and a complex and sometimes mysterious plot.\n\
  It is a story of a woman who loves a man, and teaches him to change. Not out of\
  \ his love for her, but simply because it was the right thing to do.\nMacDonald\
  \ allows the characters a range from delightful to devious. As such, they were intended\
  \ to serve as models. His message is that all eventually must stand before God.\n\
